		"Welcome to Palomino Creek Ammu-Nation, the only local gun store in Palomino Creek.
		This ammu-nation is run by Gvardia Ammu-Nation Co., which is part of Gvardia Corporation.",
		"Gvardia Ammu-Nation Co. is founded by Gvardia Corporation in 2008,
		just after the purchase of the Ocean Flats Ammu-Nation,
		which is the first business that the Gvardia Corporation first purchased when it was founded. 
		In its history it became the biggest arms company in producing and supplying the market, with 
		stores all over San Andreas. After the government's nationalization of private businesses, 
		the company had a tough path, to regain its position in the market. Today the company is back on its feet,
		conrolling over fifty percent of the market.",
		"At our ammu-nation you may purchase every assault rifle, shotgun, pistols, long-range rifles, everything our state allows."
